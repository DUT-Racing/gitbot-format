# gitbot-format
A GitHub App using the [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) framework

Keeps your repos tidy by running ```clang-format``` on every PR.

[Install to your repo!](https://github.com/apps/gitbot-format)

## Features
### Respects repo stylefile
Just a regular ```.clang-format``` file in the root of the repo.
Looks on the default branch first, PR branch second, and lastly defaults
to ```-style=Google```.
### Zero setup
No setup neccessary, just install in GitHub and enjoy.
### Fully stateless
On every restart it rechecks all open PRs in installed repos.
Making it easy to restart/upgrade/migrate/manage the deployment.

## FAQ
### Why prefer stylefile from the default branch to feature branch stylefile.
> Since the goal is to keep the format of the whole codebase consistent,
> prefering the default branch stylefile will enforce the same style on all
> feature branches and make changes to the stylefile propagate instantly
> (no need to rebase every feature branch)
